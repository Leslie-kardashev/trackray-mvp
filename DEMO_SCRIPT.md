### **Introduction (30 seconds)**

**(As the main presenter hands over to you)**

"Thank you. What I want to show you now is how TrackRay's technology brings all those concepts to life in a unified, real-time platform."

"We've architected TrackRay from the ground up for scalability and security, using a modern tech stack with Next.js and Google's Firebase platform. This ensures that whether a business is tracking 10 deliveries or 10,000, the experience remains fast and reliable."

"Let's start by looking at the different roles within a typical logistics company."

### **Part 1: The Core Workflow - From Order to Dispatch (2 minutes)**

**Action 1: Log in as Sales**

**(Navigate to the login screen. Select 'Sales' from the dropdown.)**

"We begin with the **Sales** role. Their job is to get customer orders into the system quickly and accurately. We've built role-based access control right into the core of the platform, so every user sees only what they need to."

**(Log in. You are now on the Sales dashboard.)**

"The Sales Hub is clean and focused. Let's quickly onboard a new customer."

**Action 2: Onboard a New Customer & Create an Order**

**(Click on the 'Customer Management' tab, then 'Add New Customer'. Fill out the form quickly.)**

"We can onboard a new customer in seconds. All data is validated and securely stored in our Firestore database."

**(Click on the 'Order Management' tab, then 'Create New Order'. Select the customer you just created and fill in the order details.)**

"Now, the sales rep creates an order for that customer. This form is designed for speed and clarity. Once created, this order is instantly available across the entire platform."

**Action 3: Assign a Driver**

**(Find the 'Pending' order you just created and click 'Assign Driver'.)**

"Here's the critical handoff. The order is pending. The sales rep—or an admin—can immediately assign an available driver. The system shows only drivers who are actually available for a trip."

**(Select a driver from the dialog and assign them.)**

"With that click, the order status is updated to 'Ready for Pickup', and a notification is effectively sent to the warehouse. The driver also gets their new assignment. This entire workflow, from sales to dispatch, is now seamlessly connected."

---

### **Part 2: The On-the-Ground Operations (2 minutes)**

**Action 4: Log in as Warehouse**

**(Log out and log back in as the 'Warehouse' role.)**

"Now, let's switch to the **Warehouse**. Their dashboard is focused on physical inventory and getting orders out the door."

"Here in the 'Awaiting Pickup' section, they see the order we just assigned, sorted by FIFO priority. The warehouse team knows exactly what to prepare and which driver is coming for it. We've even added priority badges for late or due pickups to prevent delays."

**Action 5: Confirm Pickup**

**(Find the order and click 'Mark as Picked Up'.)**

"Once the driver arrives and the goods are loaded, the warehouse team marks it as picked up. This single click updates the order status to 'Moving' and triggers the real-time tracking."

**Action 6: Log in as Driver & Use Route AI**

**(Log out and log back in as the 'Driver' role.)**

"Now for the **Driver**. Their dashboard is their co-pilot. They see their assigned deliveries and, most importantly, our Route AI tool."

**(Go to the Route Optimizer section. The fields should be pre-filled with an active delivery.)**

"This is our defensible advantage. We don't just give them a map. Our Route AI uses Genkit and Google's Gemini model to analyze real-time traffic data, vehicle type, and historical patterns. It provides not just a route, but an *intelligent recommendation*."

**(Click 'Generate Route'.)**

"As you can see, it generates turn-by-turn directions, an estimated travel time, and a fuel consumption estimate. This turns a major variable cost—fuel—into a predictable expense, directly impacting the customer's bottom line."

---

### **Part 3: The 360° View & Customer Experience (1.5 minutes)**

**Action 7: Log in as Superadmin**

**(Log out and log back in as the 'Admin' role.)**

"So where does all this activity come together? At the **Superadmin** level. This is the command center for the entire business."

"The admin gets a 360-degree view of operations: high-level financial stats, sales performance, and a live fleet map. You can see the truck for the order we've been following, moving in real-time on the map."

**Action 8: Showcase the SOS Alert**

**(Point to the SOS Alerts panel on the right.)**

"We've also integrated a critical safety feature. If a driver is in trouble, they can hit an SOS button on their app. An alert immediately appears here, on the admin dashboard, with the driver's name and location, enabling an instant response."

**Action 9: Log in as Customer & View Invoice**

**(Log out and log back in as the 'Customer' role.)**

"Finally, the **Customer**. They are kept informed throughout the process. They can see their order history and track active deliveries on a map."

**(Click on the order you've been tracking, then click the 'View Invoice' button.)**

"And to close the loop, we've automated the paperwork. The customer can view a professionally generated invoice for any of their orders and download it directly as a PDF. This saves time for both them and the finance team."

### **Conclusion (30 seconds)**

"So, in just a few minutes, we've followed a single order through four different roles—Sales, Warehouse, Driver, and Customer—and seen how the Superadmin oversees it all."

"TrackRay isn't just a collection of features; it's a unified, intelligent system that connects every part of a logistics business, driving efficiency, cutting costs, and providing unparalleled visibility. Thank you."
