## Chronicle Pitch Deck Super Prompt for TrackRay

**1. Deck Title:** TrackRay: AI-Powered Logistics & Fleet Management for a New Era of Efficiency

**2. Target Audience:** Potential Investors (Venture Capitalists, Angel Investors), Strategic Partners in the logistics and e-commerce sectors. The tone should be professional, confident, and forward-looking, but accessible—avoiding overly technical jargon where possible.

**3. Visual Style & Branding:**
*   **Theme:** Modern, tech-forward, clean, and data-driven.
*   **Color Palette:** Use our primary brand colors. Deep blues and purples (`#4B0082`, `#6A5ACD`) for backgrounds and accents, a vibrant primary color (`hsl(var(--primary))`, like a bright violet) for calls to action and data highlights, and clean white/light gray text for readability.
*   **Imagery:** Use a mix of our actual app screenshots, professional photos of trucks and warehouses in Ghana, and abstract data visualizations. All imagery should feel dynamic and professional. For any icons, use a clean, outline style similar to Lucide icons.
*   **Logo:** Prominently feature the TrackRay logo on the title slide and subtly on the footer of other slides.
